Year,Changes
2002,Survey’s inception. Delta Smelt are returned to the lab for sampling. Delta Smelt lengths are formalin preserved for this year.
2003,"Delta Smelt are measured and counted in the field, and thus, lengths are not formalin preserved. Sex and maturity/egg stages for all Delta Smelt are determined in the field. Sampling only takes place February to May; a January survey is not conducted."
2004,"Egg samples are only retained for stage 4 females, collecting no more than 30 stage 4 females per station. "
2004,"Halfway through survey 3, the cod-end was caught in the propeller; the replacement cod-end had a 1/8” mesh (instead of 1/4”) for the rest of the year."
2005,Station 719 (Sacramento Deep Water Channel) added. Only egg samples from stage 3 and 4 females are retained. 1/8” cod end mesh still used.
2006,No egg or caudal fin samples are collected or retained.
2007,Cod end mesh changed from 1/8” back to 1/4” mesh. 
2008,Elimination of Supplemental Surveys to reduce Delta Smelt take.
2009,Implementation of two 5-minute tows to reduce Delta Smelt take. 
2010,Begin recording turbidity in NTU’s using a Hach Model #2100P turbidity meter. Survey 11 is a Smelt Turbidity Study.
2011,
2012,Delta Smelt are field staged and preserved whole in liquid nitrogen
2013,
2014,New nets purchased (made to standard specifications) on 03/25/2014 and used for the remaining of the season. Implementation of a new data management system. Data is now hosted in a back-end and uploaded to a Tier 3 server for display on the webpage.

2015,"Delta Smelt Abundance Index calculations was reviewed, and changes were made. See 2015 Delta Smelt abundance index memo for details."
