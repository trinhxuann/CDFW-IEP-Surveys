This package attempts to create a system for publishing various Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) datasets built primarily in R. This is a new, parallel system that attempts to increase the efficiency, consistency, transparency, and flexibility of the data publication process for these datasets.

Currently, this framework has been applied to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) Smelt Larval Survey (SLS). The overall workflow of the scripts is shown in the figure below:
