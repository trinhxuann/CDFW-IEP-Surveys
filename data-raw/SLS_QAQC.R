# Reading in the base tables ----------------------------------------------
# This script should be ran after creating the databases script. I will assume
# that the rds file is also created during that process and will only import
# that file here. It contains all of the individual base .csv files in one

data <- readRDS(file.path("data-raw", "SLS", "SLSTables.rds"))

# This is a stylistic preference. I believe that it is more efficient to house the data in this way
# It keeps the environment cleaner and allows you to run apply functions through each element in the list
outliers <- list()

# When this analysis is up to date, you will likely only want to see data from
# the current season. Currently, the season for SLS spans from Dec-Mar of each WY
# Also adding a second requirement that the latest data entry is later than Dec 1 of current year
# To find yearOfInterest, take today and add a 1 to it IF the current season is underway, 
# so if today is AFTER Dec 1 AND if there is data entered that is AFTER Dec 1 as well.

# The "NAFlag" column will flag values with NAs;

# NAFlag will be present across all "queries"
# Outlier column will also be present across all "queries"
