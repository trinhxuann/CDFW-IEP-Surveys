Year,Processing
2002,"The first year of the SKT during which all Delta Smelt were returned to the laboratory to determine sex and maturity stage (which includes the collection of eggs from females). As a result, all Delta Smelt lengths recorded for this year are affected by the effects of formalin preservation, i.e., shrinkage."
2003,"Delta Smelt were returned to the laboratory during Surveys 11 (December) and 1 (January) to determine sexual maturity stage; the previously described formalin effects on fork length applies to these samples. For the remainder of the season, Delta Smelt were processed (sex and maturity stages) on board and, thus, all fork lengths for those individuals are fresh, i.e., not affected by shrinkage caused by formalin preservation."
2004,"Due to limited funding, only egg samples from stage 4 females were retained, with a limit of no more than 30 stage 4 individuals per station. Sex and maturity stage data were still recorded for all individuals."
2005,"Egg samples were taken only from stage 3 and 4 females, with a limit of no more than 20 fish per tow during non-supplementa surveysl and 30 fish per tow during supplemental surveys."
2006-present,"All sampling is done on board. Egg samples are not explicitly sampled for other studies, and the entire fish is preserved."
